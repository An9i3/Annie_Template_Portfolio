# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

My first milestone is including all the components of the Clock together. In this case, i can either could the seconds in the clock or change the colors of the clock. A button is wired to the Arduino send in a signal to allow the light to become a different color for a set amount of time, in my milestone video, 8 seconds. This code helps me figure out how to cotinue with my next step, adding the hour and minutes. For my "time" part, I wired the leds to the arduino along with a clock device, "HW-084". Then I put in a code which allowed the pixels to pop up one by one and when it goes past 60, the number that pops up goes back to 1.
