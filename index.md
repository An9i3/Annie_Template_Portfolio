An infinity clock is a clock including an ilusion that make lights look as if it goes on for forever.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is building the physical project. It includes a mirror, a oneway mirror, the LEDs, and the mirror box. The light is reflected from the mirror, to the onsided mirror, to the mirror, creating an ilusion, or virtual image of the mirror, that have a virtual image of another mirror and so on to create the illusion of the "infinity Mirror". Because on of the mirrors is a onesided mirror, you could see through the mirror without seeing your own reflection. the chips and the alduano are behind the mirror and the is a hole at the top to access the button.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is the completion is the coding for the Infinity Clock. Truth to be told, I tried to finish the code, but was unable to do so. It was my instructor who helped me finish. So, I understood about less than half of what the code actually does. The following video is me trying to explain it.

My first milestone is including all the components of the Clock together. In this case, I can either could the seconds in the clock or change the colors of the clock. A button is wired to the Arduino send in a signal to allow the light to become a different color for a set amount of time, in my milestone video, 8 seconds. This code helps me figure out how to cotinue with my next step, adding the hour and minutes. For my "time" part, I wired the leds to the arduino along with a clock device, "HW-084". Then I put in a code which allowed the pixels to pop up one by one and when it goes past 60, the number that pops up goes back to 1.
